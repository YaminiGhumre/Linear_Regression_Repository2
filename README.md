Objective : Build a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using Python.
There are two datasets which are shared - 
1. Delivery Time.

Solution : Data Pre-processing Steps.
Fitting the MLR model to the training set.
Predicting the result of the test set.

Result : The r2 score tells that our model is 92% accurate with the training dataset and 93% accurate with the test dataset.
